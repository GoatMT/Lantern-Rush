# LANTERN RUSH — gameplay and feature audit

Checked September 12, 2026 in the standalone **LSL Game** project.

Historical audit: on September 13, the separate Steal control was replaced by automatic standing steals, and Mobile Cam was added. Current controls are documented in README.md; focused regression checks are in tests/mobile-camera.test.js.

**Result:** 123 automated tests passed with no failures; 164 JavaScript/import/static-asset checks passed. The full automated gameplay run completed in approximately 2.2 seconds. Browser checks reported no console errors.

## Fixes made in this audit

- Restored manual switching while a pass is travelling. Immediate ball recovery now takes priority over predicted defensive positioning when a player is already close to the ball.
- Made duplicate or partially saved keyboard bindings recover to unique usable keys, preserving accepted custom bindings.
- Kept consecutive charged fake shots as fake shots, so releasing Shoot does not accidentally fire.
- Protected a goalkeeper's held catch from standing/sliding steals and inappropriate dribble skills.
- Canceled an outgoing restart taker's pending kick when substituted, preserved the incoming player's possession flag, and honored the stoppage presentation delay.
- Kept substitution notifications visible for the full five-second presentation.
- Removed joystick/STEAL overlap in the mirrored layout on narrow portrait phones. Verified separate, visible targets at 320 × 568.

## Performance and limits

The live match reported **60 FPS** at an **844 × 390 viewport**, High graphics, on this PC's in-app browser. This is a short desktop rendering sample with a phone-sized viewport, not a physical-phone benchmark. Lower-end phones, iOS Safari and a published GitHub Pages URL were not directly tested in this audit. Low graphics and adaptive rendering remain available.

The jersey audit verifies **235 of 278** entries. **43 numbers are unavailable**, with **1 source conflict** and **7 duplicate-number groups** recorded in `data/jersey-audit.json`. Missing numbers remain unprinted; published duplicates and documented overrides are preserved rather than invented.

These checks cover the implemented systems and exercised scenarios. They do not guarantee every possible input combination or device will be error-free.

## Re-run locally

```sh
npm test
npm run check
npm start
```

`tests/feature-audit.test.js` contains the move-by-move and interaction regressions added during this audit. Other feature tests remain in `tests/`.
